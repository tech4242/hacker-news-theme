Make a pull request with your own version!

## Guide for non-ninjas:

1. Clone/download this repo
2. Download a tool like [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/stylish/) (there is one for Chrome as well)
3. Paste the theme you like as a custom CSS in there and define the URLs that it should be applicable to. In this case "URLs starting with" https://news.ycombinator.com/ - Essentially a wildcard for this domain where the CSS should be loaded
4. Enjoy :)
